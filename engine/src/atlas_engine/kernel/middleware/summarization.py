"""Summarization middleware for automatic and tool-based conversation compaction.

This module provides two middleware classes and a convenience factory:

- `SummarizationMiddleware` — automatically compacts the conversation when token
    usage exceeds a configurable threshold.

    Older messages are summarized via an LLM call and the full history is
    offloaded to a backend for later retrieval.
- `SummarizationToolMiddleware` — exposes a `compact_conversation` tool that
    lets the agent (or a human-in-the-loop approval flow) trigger compaction on
    demand.

    Composes with a `SummarizationMiddleware` instance and reuses its
    summarization engine.
- `create_summarization_tool_middleware` — convenience factory that creates both
    middleware layers with model-aware defaults.

## Usage

```python
from atlas_engine.kernel import create_deep_agent
from atlas_engine.kernel.middleware.summarization import (
    SummarizationMiddleware,
    SummarizationToolMiddleware,
)
from atlas_engine.kernel.backends import FilesystemBackend

backend = FilesystemBackend(root_dir="/data")

summ = SummarizationMiddleware(
    model="gpt-5.5",
    backend=backend,
    trigger=("fraction", 0.85),
    keep=("fraction", 0.10),
)
tool_mw = SummarizationToolMiddleware(summ)

agent = create_deep_agent(middleware=[summ, tool_mw])
```

## Storage

Offloaded messages are stored as markdown at `/conversation_history/{session_id}.md`,
where `session_id` is an internally generated per-invocation id.

Each summarization event appends a new section to this file, creating a running
log of all evicted messages. Base64 media in evicted messages is written
separately under `<artifacts_root>/conversation_history/media/` and referenced
by path from the markdown, so the history file stays text-only (see
`_offload_inline_media` for the exact path).

## Summary prompt

`DEEPAGENTS_DEFAULT_SUMMARY_PROMPT` augments LangChain's `DEFAULT_SUMMARY_PROMPT`
with a kernel-specific addendum explaining the media reference tags that the
offloading behavior introduces, so the summarizing model knows to preserve them.
It is the default `summary_prompt` for `SummarizationMiddleware` and both
factories.

        Identical media across messages are deduped by content hash.

        Failures are tracked per block. A block whose upload failed -- or whose
        payload could not be decoded -- is replaced with an
        `<image error="failed_to_offload" />` text placeholder; a successfully
        uploaded block is rewritten to a typed media reference block. The caller
        receives the count of failed blocks so it can warn that those media are
        unrecoverable.

                unchanged. `failed_block_count` is the number of media blocks

        Finally offloads messages to backend before summarization if thresholds are met.

        Control flow details:

        - If thresholds say "do not summarize", we still attempt one normal
            model call with the current effective/truncated messages.
        - If that call raises `ContextOverflowError`, we immediately fall back
            to the summarization path and retry the model call with
            `summary_message + preserved_recent_messages`.

        Unlike the legacy `abefore_model` approach, this does NOT modify the LangGraph state.
        Instead, it tracks summarization events in middleware state and modifies the model
        request directly.

    ## Why this exists

    The `SummarizationMiddleware` wraps
    `langchain.agents.middleware.SummarizationMiddleware` to add behavior
    long-running, file-aware agents need. Prefer LangChain's middleware
    directly if none of the below apply:

    - **Backend offload of evicted history.** Evicted messages are appended
        to `/conversation_history/{session_id}.md` (default path) on the
        configured backend before the summary replaces them, and the
        summary embeds that path so the agent can re-open it via
        `read_file` when `FilesystemMiddleware` is registered. LangChain
        drops evicted messages with no recovery path.
    - **Pre-summarization tool-arg truncation.** Large `write_file` /
        `edit_file` arguments in older messages are clipped at a lower
        threshold than full compaction, often reclaiming enough context
        to skip summarizing. Configured via `truncate_args_settings`.
    - **`ContextOverflowError` fallback.** On a provider over-budget
        rejection the middleware summarizes and retries instead of
        bubbling the error up.
    - **Non-mutating message state.** Summarization is tracked in a
        private `_summarization_event` field via `wrap_model_call`,
        leaving `state["messages"]` intact. LangChain rewrites it with
        `RemoveMessage(id=REMOVE_ALL_MESSAGES)` from `before_model`.
        Preserving the raw log enables replay, evals, and shared state
        with `SummarizationToolMiddleware`'s `compact_conversation` tool.
    - **Auto-selected trigger/keep thresholds.** LangChain accepts
        fraction-based thresholds but defaults to `trigger=None` and
        `keep=("messages", 20)`. This factory picks fraction-based
        defaults from the model's profile when `max_input_tokens` is
        exposed, falling back to fixed counts otherwise — see
        `compute_summarization_defaults`.

    Args:
        model: Resolved `BaseChatModel` instance.

    Convenience factory: builds a `SummarizationMiddleware` via

    accepts a model string.

    ## What you get

    Only the tool layer is registered — the wrapped `SummarizationMiddleware`
    is the engine the tool calls into, not a middleware that runs on its
    own. The agent gains:

    - A `compact_conversation` tool to compact its own context window
    - An eligibility gate at ~50% of the auto-summarization trigger so
        the tool refuses to compact too early

    ## Pairing with auto-summarization

    For *automatic* summarization at the trigger threshold, also register
    a `SummarizationMiddleware`. `create_deep_agent` adds one by default,
    so dropping `create_summarization_tool_middleware(...)` into its
    `middleware=[...]` gives you both layers; they share state via the
    `_summarization_event` key.

    Args:
        model: Chat model instance, or a model string
            (e.g. `"anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6"`).
        backend: Backend instance for persisting conversation history.
        system_prompt: System-prompt fragment nudging the model to call
            `compact_conversation`. Pass `None` to skip appending the nudge.

    Returns:
        Configured `SummarizationToolMiddleware` instance.

    Example:
        Using the default `StateBackend`:

        ```python
        from atlas_engine.kernel import create_deep_agent
        from atlas_engine.kernel.backends import StateBackend
        from atlas_engine.kernel.middleware.summarization import (

                create_summarization_tool_middleware(model, StateBackend()),
            ],
        )
        ```

        Using a custom backend instance (e.g., Daytona Sandbox):

    This middleware composes with a `SummarizationMiddleware` instance, reusing

    This middleware never compacts automatically. Compaction only occurs when
    `compact_conversation` is called as a normal tool call (by the model or by
    an explicit user action, e.g. as implemented in a CLI front-end).

    To avoid compacting too early, compact tool execution is gated by
    `_is_eligible_for_compaction`, which requires reported usage to reach about
    50% of the configured auto-summarization trigger.

    The tool and auto-summarization share the same `_summarization_event` state
