"""Beta APIs for configuring deep agent runtime behavior.

!!! beta

    `kernel.profiles` exposes beta APIs that may receive minor changes in
    future releases. Refer to the versioning documentation
    for more details.

Harness profiles declare how `create_deep_agent` should shape the agent's
runtime behavior for a given provider or specific model spec. They tune
prompt assembly, tool visibility, middleware, and default subagent behavior
*after* the chat model has been constructed — orthogonal to
`ProviderProfile`, which controls the model-construction phase.

Users may register profiles via `register_harness_profile`. The kernel
ships built-in harness profiles for several frontier model specs.
They may be layered on top of via additive merge semantics.

        `kernel.profiles` exposes beta APIs that may receive minor changes in
        future releases. Refer to the versioning documentation
        for more details.

    A `HarnessProfileConfig` contains the file-friendly subset of harness
    settings: plain strings, bools, lists, and nested dicts that can be loaded
    from YAML or JSON. For in-code/runtime-only adjustments such as
    `extra_middleware` or class-form `excluded_middleware`, use
    `HarnessProfile` instead.

    !!! note "Class-path serialization"

        `excluded_middleware` in config files currently only accepts plain
        middleware-name strings matched against `AgentMiddleware.name`. A
        future revision may add explicit class-path (`module:Class`) entries
        for excluding middleware whose class isn't part of the public import
        surface; until then, exclude such middleware via its `.name` (using
        `serialized_name` for stable public aliases) or stay on the runtime
        `HarnessProfile` and pass the class directly.

    Config objects may be passed directly to `register_harness_profile`; the
    helper converts them to runtime `HarnessProfile` objects automatically.

    Example:
        Construct a config object directly in Python:

        ```python
        from atlas_engine.kernel import HarnessProfileConfig, register_harness_profile

        register_harness_profile(

        for more details.

    A `HarnessProfile` describes prompt-assembly, tool visibility, middleware,
    and default-subagent adjustments applied by `create_deep_agent` once a
    chat model has been constructed. Profiles are registered via
    `register_harness_profile` under a provider key (`"openai"`) or a full
    `provider:model` key (`"openai:gpt-5.4"`).

    This complements `ProviderProfile`, which controls the model-construction
    phase (e.g. `init_chat_model` kwargs, pre-init side effects). Concerns
    that shape *how the model is built* belong in `ProviderProfile`; concerns
    that shape *how the agent runs* belong here.

    For YAML/JSON-backed profiles, use `HarnessProfileConfig`, which contains
    only the declarative subset and can be passed directly to
    `register_harness_profile`.

    The `extra_middleware` field expects
    `langchain.agents.middleware.types.AgentMiddleware` instances or a
    factory returning a sequence of them.

    Example:
        Minimal — append a model-specific system-prompt suffix:

        ```python
        from atlas_engine.kernel import HarnessProfile, register_harness_profile

        register_harness_profile(

    `__name__` but is overridable, so `{FilesystemMiddleware}` (class form) and
    `{"FilesystemMiddleware"}` (name form) behave identically for stock
    middleware.

    Prefer class form when the class is importable: typos surface at import
    time rather than at agent construction. Reserve string form for
    YAML/JSON-loaded profiles and for middleware whose class isn't part of

        Middleware whose concrete class name differs from the public alias
        users would type (e.g. `_DeepAgentsSummarizationMiddleware` vs.
        `"SummarizationMiddleware"`) can expose a `serialized_name: ClassVar[str]`
        for stable config-file round-trips. `.name` on the instance returns
        the alias so string-form exclusion matches, and
        `HarnessProfileConfig.from_harness_profile` serializes the class back
        to that alias.

    !!! warning "Restrictions"

        - String grammar is checked at construction: empty, colon-containing,
            and underscore-prefixed names raise `ValueError` immediately.
            Class-path (`module:Class`) entries are not currently supported
            and may be added in a future revision; pass the class itself
            through the runtime `HarnessProfile` instead.
        - Scaffolding classes (`FilesystemMiddleware`, `SubAgentMiddleware`)
            cannot be excluded as class or as their `.name` string. The check
            fires at `HarnessProfile` construction,
            so register-site typos fail fast rather than waiting until
            `create_deep_agent` resolves the profile. To hide their tools
            from the model without removing the middleware, use
            `excluded_tools` instead — the runtime rejection message points
            at the same workaround.
